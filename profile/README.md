## Synaptik Core

Synaptik Core is a distributed cognitive substrate for intelligent systems. Our mission is to provide a foundational layer for AI that standardizes properties like persistent state, governance, traceability, and recovery across machine learning workflows, large language models, and autonomous systems.

### What We Do

Synaptik Core provides a substrate for AI. We address the foundational challenge of *cognitive plumbing*, allowing researchers and developers to focus on higher-level reasoning and innovation instead of recreating core infrastructure.

Our technology converts the opaque internal operations of complex AI systems into analyzable state-space models, enabling deep instrumentation, observability, and recovery. Synaptik Core is designed to help systems maintain coherent internal state over time, adapt safely to change, and support auditing and governance as first-class concerns rather than afterthoughts.

### Contribution Guidelines

Synaptik Core is currently in the early stages of development. We are not yet accepting public code contributions. However, we are actively seeking collaboration in the following areas:

* **Pilot Programs:** Institutions and development teams interested in applying Synaptik Core to real-world AI challenges.
* **Research Collaboration:** Academic and research organizations exploring system reliability, safety, governance, and long-lived AI behavior.
* **Feedback:** Insights from AI developers, safety researchers, and systems architects.

### Useful Resources

Official documentation and technical whitepapers are in development and will be released in the near future. As the project matures, this repository will host core documentation, API specifications, and usage guides.
